# steganon GIMP lsb image extractor
This is a plug-in written specifically for my genesis Nifty Gateway drop. Below are directions for usage.

# 1. Download and install GIMP
- GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a free alternative to PhotoShop
- Download from https://www.gimp.org/

## For GIMP version 2, Place steganon_lsb_image_extractor.py in the GIMP plug-ins folder
## For GIMP version 3, Place the steganon_lsb_image_extractor_gimpv3 folder in the GIMP plug-ins folder
If you don't know where the plug-ins folder is: 
- Open GIMP and navigate to Edit->Preferences
- Scroll down in the left hand menu and click the plus sign next to Folders to expand the group
- Click Plug-ins under the Folders group
- Note the folders listed.
- Copy the file to one of the folders listed
- If you are running linux, ensure the file is executable.

## Using GIMP, open a steganon artwork which has an embedded hidden image

## Click menu item Filters->steganon->Extract Hidden Image

## Wait a minute or so to see the extracted image.
